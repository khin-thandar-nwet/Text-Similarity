# Text-Similarity
Sentence Similarity with BERT and SBERT

**BERT** excels in tasks such as sentiment analysis, question answering, and named entity recognition, where **word-level granularity **is crucial.

**Sentence Transformers** are the preferred choice for semantic similarity assessments, text matching, and document retrieval tasks, where capturing the essence of **entire sentences or paragraphs** is essential.

**Fuzzy** excels when the focus is on **character-level similarities**, making it a valuable tool for tasks like deduplication of records, correcting typos, and matching strings with minor variations.
